This paper reports the organization of an event that enabled experts as well as non-specialists to practice Artificial Intelligence on robots, with the goal to enforce human-AI cooperation. The end aim of this paper is to make the material and virtual platform built for the event reusable by as many people as possible, so that the event can be reproduced and can give rise to new discoveries or to the production of new data sets and benchmarks. The underlying purpose is to de-demonize AI and to foster group work around a fun, rewarding and caring project.
