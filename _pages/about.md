I am a Teaching and Research Assistant (ATER) at the National Engineering School of Brest (ENIB) and a member of the LabSTICC laboratory.
My research focuses on optimization and automation in machine learning, particularly AutoML, Deep Learning, and bio-inspired approaches to Artificial Intelligence.
I aim to develop AI systems that learn more effectively and efficiently.
